0.6 release notes
=================

0.6 introduces the following changes:

* :class:`.Video`, :class:`.VideoFeed`, and :class:`.VideoSearch` are now in
  :mod:`vidscraper.videos`.
* :class:`VideoLoaders <.VideoLoader>` were introduced as a more generic way
  to represent getting data for a single video.
* :mod:`vidscraper.errors` was renamed to :mod:`vidscraper.exceptions`, and
  unused exceptions were removed. :exc:`.CantIdentifyUrl` was split into two
  exceptions (:exc:`.UnhandledVideo` and :exc:`UnhandledFeed`) and
  :exc:`Error` is now :exc:`.VidscraperError`.
* :func:`vidscraper.handles_video_url` and :func:`vidscraper.handles_feed_url`
  were renamed to :func:`vidscraper.handles_video` and
  :func:`vidscraper.handles_feed`, respectively. They now accept the same
  parameters as :func:`vidscraper.auto_scrape` and
  :func:`vidscraper.auto_feed`.
* Multiple :class:`.VideoFile`\ s are now made available for :class:`.Video`
  instances, rather than having a single set of fields on the :class:`.Video`
  class.
